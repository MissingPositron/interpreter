# interpreter

## What is it?
This project contains a toy c-like programming language that i'm implementing while studying compiler theory. 
For now the language is implemented by an interpreter that runs directly on the parsed AST, but in the future i may compile it down to bytecode or x86 machine code.

## How do i run it?
If you use an IDE import the code as 'ant' project, if not simply run `ant run-interpreter` in the project's root folder. Obviously you'll need [apache ant](http://ant.apache.org/) for the latter approach.
